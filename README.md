# Project Overview

The Feedreader project is an application built using a test-driven approach.  FeedReader test properties of rss feeds, application navigation and functionality.

## Dependancies

FeedReader uses Google FeedReader API, Javascript, JQuery, Handlebars for the core funcitonality and Jasmine provides the testing framework.


## Usage

Launch the index.html from the browser and view the Jasmine results at the bottom


# How to customize the project

1. Edit the /js/app.js with RSS feeds of your own
2. index.html has the application structure, so make updates here to change overall application
3. Update the /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js to add/update Jasmine tests.
